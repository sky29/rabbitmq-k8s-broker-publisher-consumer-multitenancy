# rabbitmq-k8s-broker-publisher-consumer-multitenancy

It is short implementation for implementing a single rabbitmq consumer, which can consume messages from multiple queues (that might belong to multiple tenants).
Note: It is a small workaround for specific business scenario (not complete multi-tenant rabbitmq client code)
